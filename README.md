# agol-dl-attachments

## Usage

1) Run the script
2) Select the layer of interest
3) Select the folder that corresponds to the layer name
4) Script creates a directory in the folder for each layer (if one doesnt exist already)

## Notes

Attachment name format: `objectId-attachmentId-attachmentName`

The script checks to see if an attachment was already downloaded to that folder. If it was, it skips that attachment. You can select the same folder each time you want to download new attachments - this will prevent all attachments from downloading every time the script is run.
